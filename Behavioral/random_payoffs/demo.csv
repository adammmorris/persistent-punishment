And my strategy was when I went second, I punished people who stole from me and not people who didn't. When I went first, I tried stealing once because I was desperate because that asshole John bankrupted me, but of course when I stole my partner punished me, so after that I played fair.","2017-06-21 18:18:01","1000"

But then it was just hurting me, so I thought switching to 0-0 might persuade him to change his answers, but nope. Got screwed over by that guy! 

Then with Ryan and Josh, I noticed that they were cooperating and were willing to minimize their gains/ability to take from me, so I cooperated and reciprocated as I didn't want to punish them for being nice and doing the right thing, even if it meant I wouldn't earn much.

Fun study! Thanks so much and good luck with your research :)","2017-06-21 18:41:40","1048"

But I was willing to work with X players who chose B and I would choose D, as long as they were willing to play along.  At the time it switched to the next player I only had 15 cents left so at that point it wasn't even about the money, it was about just being respectful towards the other player.  It was a little harrowing being X, knowing that the Y person could choose C and hurt me, but I chose to approach them peacefully by choosing B and it worked, they consistently chose D.  I guess it wouldn't be rational of them to choose C for no reason since it hurts them a little bit too, but there are people out there who are into that sort of thing, I guess.","2017-06-21 18:59:08","1060"
