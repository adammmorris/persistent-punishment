But I thought about your thing that it's a real person on the other end. I don't want to screw them over.

I think the optimal strategy as player 1 is to choose +3/-3 every time no matter what they do.

I think the optimal strategy as player 2 is to choose 0/0 as long as they do. The first time the go +3/-3, you hit them back with a -1/-2, hoping they respect it and go to 0/0. But if they choose another +3/-3, just throw 0/0s, because at least you're not losing more on your turn, and they've shown they understand that they still make most money by throwing +3/-3.

But that's too cutthroat for me, so I went with peace! I did throw a single +3/-3. But it was just for fun, to see what would happen.","2017-05-30 00:17:47","426"
